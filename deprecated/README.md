# Deprecated / Historical Documents

This directory contains planning and brainstorming documents from the initial
design phase of the research-automation project. They are preserved for
historical reference but are **not** used by any active code, configuration,
or workflow.

## Contents

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `TODO_prep.md` | Original brainstorm and feature request list (35 sections) that seeded the project design. |
| `BOOTSTRAP.md` | Implementation spec (phases 1-13) given to Claude to build the initial codebase. Superseded by the working code. |
| `BOOTSTRAP-old.md` | Earlier draft of the bootstrap spec, already deprecated before the current version. |
| `BUILD_LOG.md` | Audit document mapping each sentence from the original brainstorm to what was actually implemented. |

## Why keep them?

These files document the project's origin story -- what was requested, what was
planned, and how each request was addressed. They may be useful for
understanding design decisions or revisiting deferred features.
