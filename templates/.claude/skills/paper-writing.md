# Paper Writing Skill

## Structure (Nature-style)
1. Title (< 15 words, specific, no jargon)
2. Abstract (150-250 words, standalone)
3. Introduction (problem -> gap -> contribution)
4. Results (findings with figures)
5. Discussion (interpretation, limitations, implications)
6. Methods (reproducible detail)

## Style Rules
- Active voice preferred
- Past tense for methods/results
- Present tense for established facts and discussion
- Avoid: "very", "really", "it is interesting that"
- One idea per paragraph
- First sentence = topic sentence

## Figure References
- Every figure must be referenced in text
- Reference before the figure appears
- "Figure 1 shows..." not "As shown in Figure 1..."

## Citations
- Use [Author, Year] format in text
- All citations must have BibTeX entry
- Prefer primary sources over reviews
- Include DOI when available
