## Conventions Used in These Tutorials

Throughout the tutorials you will see the following conventions:

```
$ command-to-run          # Lines starting with $ are commands you type
output line               # Lines without $ are expected output
```

Placeholders look like this:

```
<YOUR_API_KEY>            # Replace with your actual value (remove the angle brackets)
```
