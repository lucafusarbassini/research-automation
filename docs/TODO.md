FOR FUTURE

Notification replies — CONFIRMED NOT IMPLEMENTED                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                 
  The notification system (Slack, email, desktop) is send-only. No IMAP polling, no webhook ingestion, no workflow pause/resume on user reply. This would require a persistent   
  background service to poll an inbox — a significant architecture addition beyond the current design. Noted as a known limitation.    

For future
* Dashboard (terminal TUI, not a mobile app or VS Code extension)!!!!!
* Copilot as alternative
* Hetzner/Namecheap purchasing automation
* Token budget hard-capping
* Cross-project learning transfer
Integrate awesome-claude-code (hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code)**
- **NOT IMPLEMENTED** — Only appears in the archived feature requests. No code references or integration.
Meta develop the package itself.. and phone is really important eg voice prompt to Claude to direct edits on paperbot on hetzner machine
Also include useful materials such as stripe code, Django code... But maybe thats my personal collection which should be a database repo that user can provided with all their top materials


SOONISH
Sync w google drive for storage of key files generated
(Are all features discussed later on in the chat truly implemented o ha fatto gatto che morde coda??)
Also on new machine to emulate complete user 
Test very easy usability for multiple projects
Test on Euclid asap
What’s on 8777
Provide my own good examples for my own deployment - see quaderno

FUTURE:
Connect to my gmail and other materials
Add capability of package making using pypi API and zenodo publishing with their API
No-claude options eg w copilot backend
Wire in paperbot
Wired article writer
Email forward reaching agent with awareness and RAG eg startup screening & forward reach per ewer
Include useful templates for everything (let it do that) eg all journals one might want to submit to say the least

Compare biomni
and others of my interest see Hawaiian notes eg for event organization
Meta-updatability by me as other repos created through it!
A document with resources for possible future implementations: https://claudemarketplaces.com/
Think deeply of how it can support my dreams
Include more of these (and other) tools: https://github.com/ruvnet
